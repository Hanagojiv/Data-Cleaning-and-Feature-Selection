# Machine Learning: Data Cleaning and Feature Selection

## Premise

Data Cleaning and Feature Selection are fundamental processes in preparing and refining datasets for machine learning tasks. Before diving into the specifics of this analysis, let's establish a clear understanding of these crucial data preprocessing steps.

### Data Cleaning

**Data Cleaning** refers to the process of identifying and correcting or handling errors, inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and missing values within a dataset. It aims to ensure that the data is in a format that can be effectively utilized for analysis and modeling. Data cleaning involves various tasks such as handling missing values, addressing outliers, and resolving data inconsistencies. By the end of the data cleaning process, the dataset should be reliable, accurate, and devoid of issues that could compromise the quality of any subsequent analysis or model building.

### :atom: Feature Selection

**Feature Selection** is the process of identifying and choosing the most relevant and significant features (or variables) from a dataset to be used for modeling. The objective is to optimize the performance of a machine learning model by focusing on the most informative attributes while reducing dimensionality and noise. Feature selection helps in improving model efficiency, reducing overfitting, and enhancing the interpretability of the model.

With these definitions in mind, let's delve into the analysis:

## Background

In recognition of the International Day of Happiness on March 20, the World Happiness Report for 2015 was unveiled. This annual report rates 155 nations based on their happiness levels and has gained global attention as governments, organizations, and civil society increasingly rely on happiness indices to inform policy decisions. Experts from diverse fields such as economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, and public policy have collaborated to explore how well-being indicators can be harnessed to assess a nation's progress. The report not only presents the current global state of happiness but also delves into how variations in happiness, both individual and regional, are explained by the emerging science of happiness.

## Abstract

The primary objective of this notebook is to predict the happiness scores of countries worldwide by considering various influencing factors, including economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. The notebook employs an array of statistical methods, including p-value analysis, t-statistics, and data visualization techniques such as histograms, Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plots, scatter plots, and box plots, leveraging Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

### Data Cleaning

The data cleaning phase encompasses tasks such as:
- Identifying and handling missing values.
- Assessing and addressing data outliers.
- Ensuring data consistency and accuracy.

### Feature Selection

Feature selection involves determining the significance of independent variables in predicting the happiness score. The analysis addresses questions such as:
- Which independent variables are useful for predicting the happiness score?
- Do the predictor variables correlate with each other, or are they independent?
- What is the importance of each predictor variable in the modeling process?

In summary, the data appears to be well-prepared and clean, with no evident missing or inconsistent values. The significance of the predictor variables has been scrutinized, revealing that all independent variables are significant, except for one. These findings can be utilized to fine-tune the model for predicting the Happiness score, leading to improved predictive accuracy.

## Happiness Score

The Happiness Score is a metric measured in 2015 by posing a simple question to a sample of individuals: "How would you rate your happiness on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 representing the highest level of happiness?"

## Predictor Variables/Independent Variables

1. **Country**: This denotes the name of each country.
2. **Region**: Indicates the region or continent to which each country belongs.
3. **Happiness Rank**: Ranks countries based on their happiness scores.
4. **Standard Error**: Quantifies the standard error associated with the happiness score.
5. **Economy (GDP per Capita)**: Measures the monetary value of the final goods and services, and assesses the contribution of GDP to the Happiness score.
6. **Family**: Measures the extent to which family values contribute to the calculation of the Happiness score.
7. **Health (Life Expectancy)**: Quantifies the contribution of health and life expectancy to the happiness score.
8. **Freedom**: Evaluates the level of freedom enjoyed by people in each country and its contribution to the Happiness score.
9. **Trust (Government Corruption)**: Considers trust and government corruption values within a country, affecting the Happiness score.
10. **Generosity**: Reflects the quality of being kind and generous.
11. **Dystopia Residual**: Represents the sum of the dystopia happiness score (fixed at 1.85), which corresponds to the score of a hypothetical country ranked lower than the lowest-ranking country in the report.

## Conclusion

The comprehensive analysis conducted within this notebook suggests that the Happiness Score can be accurately predicted using almost all the independent variables. Each independent variable has been found to be significant based on regression results. This valuable insight can be leveraged to refine the predictive model, ultimately resulting in more precise predictions of happiness scores.
